### Hi there 👋

I'm Terri. I'm all about coding, crafting & creating. If you call me Terri Ann I promise you won't sound like my mother scolding me 😉

- 📍 Living in Vermont
- 🐔 18 chickens on the homestead
- 🐶 Abby the English Lab
- 💻 I work at Automattic ([WordPress VIP](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wordpressvip/))
- 🧵 I love to sew
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 🤷‍♀️ Fun fact: My favorite hard cider is Woodchuck's 802 Lil' Dry a semi-dry made from 100% Vermont apples.
- 🎨 Making: A blazer so I can feel fancy when I get to meet my co-workers in person this year! 🎉

<!-- Check the history; I may update with different fun facts in the future. -->
