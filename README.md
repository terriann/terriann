### Hi there 👋

I'm Terri. I'm all about coding, crafting & creating.

- 📍 Living in Vermont
- 🐔 ~23~ 70-ish chickens on the homestead
- 🐶 Abby the English Lab
- 💻 I work at Automattic ([WordPress VIP](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wordpressvip/))
- 🧵 I love to sew
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 🎶 Fun fact: I'm a cider snob and prefer to drink Woodchuck's 802 Lil' Dry a semi-dry made from 100% Vermont apples.
- 🎨 Making: The garden thrive by trying to catch up with the weeds that grew out of control.

<!-- Check the history; I may update with different fun facts in the future. -->
